\section{Introduction}

The goal of my project is to examine metadata from medical-related smart home devices to evaluate the vulnerabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Recent research into the security of IoT systems has revealed significant vulnerabilities that adversaries with passive network capabilities could exploit. Even when data transmitted from smart devices to home routers is encrypted, adversaries can scrutinize metadata to obtain second order information about a user. As IoT systems expand from the home into enterprise and specialized fields, the importance of confidentiality and integrity increases. One of the most sensitive applications of IoT systems is the medical field, where patient data is extremely valuable information and needs to be closely kept in accordance with HIPAA to protect patient privacy. However, many recent innovations in medical smart devices that users can buy for their homes to track their personal health with their smartphones have the potential to leak sensitive heath information. Because of the heightened consequences of adversarial behavior in the medical field, my research focuses more closely on metadata generated from smart medical IoT devices, though it is applied more generally as a component of IoT Inspector.  

The data and metadata for this project was generated from a suite of medical IoT devices currently sold on the market, including the Withings Smart Blood Pressure Monitor, Withings Smart Scale, iHealth Smart Gluco-Monitoring System, iHealth Ease Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, and 1byOne Digital Smart Wireless Scale. These Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled devices are connected to a router access point or directly to a smartphone, which in turn is connected to the access point. In order to intercept traffic from the IoT devices, I configured a Raspberry Pi to serve as an access point and subsequently analyzed the traffic by classifying the streams by device, protocol, and encryption.

\section{Conclusions}

These results underscore multiple known vulnerabilities within IoT devices, but there are heightened implications due to the sensitive nature of the medical metadata being disclosed. Particularly if being used by healthcare professionals to measure patient vitals and track patient data over time, these medical IoT devices need to be more carefully examined by regulators and physician networks to increase the awareness of this information leakage before implemented on a wider scale. 

Additionally, the sheer diversity of devices, protocols, and lack of standardization between device manufacturers makes it very difficult to detect all vulnerabilities, or to even identify all of the devices that are connected to a network in the first place. Therefore, a tool such as IoT Inspector has tremendous market value in empowering users to regain control over their data and make their own determinations as to their toleration of risk and privacy expectations. 

My research suggests that medical IoT device manufacturers are not necessarily aligned with policies including the Privacy and Security rules of HIPAA, as they may inadvertently reveal sensitive data and metadata about a user's behavior and medical condition. For example, the Privacy rule dictates that manufacturers and medical professionals protect personally identifying information such as the individualâ€™s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition. Though I found no instances of full names, or biologically identifiable information being leaked, in the digital age, policy makers and manufacturers both should recognize the increasingly identifiable nature of IP addresses. With users carrying smartphones in their pockets 24 hours a day, completing transactions, querying the Internet, and communicating with friends, an IP address is perhaps more individually identifiable than a social security number in terms of what information an adversary could realistically gain access to. 

Lastly, my research underscores the lack of awareness among the general public when it comes to the confidentiality and integrity of their personal data. As technology becomes increasingly capable and complex, it will only become more difficult for users of connected devices to comprehend what sort of data can be extracted from their digital footprint, even if the devices they are using encrypt first order information. Tools like IoT Inspector are in the public interest to increase the visibility of device vulnerabilities, awareness of personal confidentiality weaknesses, and accountability among device manufacturers.
